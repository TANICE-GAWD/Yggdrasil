I can make your code "Un-Dockerable"....



yup, u read that right.
today, I decided to learn Docker in more depth
I have fiddled around with it before
but never officially in detail


So, like any other sane man
>> I will learn docker by

:: Yggdrasil is The World Tree from Norse Mythology
>>this injects a "root system" into the source code
>>that makes it so deeply intertwined with the host OS

Idk if this is even possible to make

Stay tuned :D
